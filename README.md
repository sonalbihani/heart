# HearT Disease Prediction using Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015, up from 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990. It is estimated that 90% of CVD is preventable. There are many risk factors for heart diseases that we will take a closer look at.

The main objective of this study is to build a model that can predict the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features (risk factors) describing the disease. Different machine learning classification techniques will be implemented and compared upon standard performance metric such as accuracy.

The dataset used for this study was taken from UCI machine learning repository, titled “Heart Disease Data Set”.
